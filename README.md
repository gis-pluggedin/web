Open Sourcing A City GIS Web Site
===

Currently, the City of Williamsburg offers it's GIS data as a downloadable  
zipped shapefile.

The city's current GIS site is an ArcGIS Flex Viewer implementation.

The purpose of this project was to replicate the base functionality of the  
city's current website using open source components.

This site uses:
* Leaflet API
* Tiles Created With Tilemill
* GIS Data as GeoJSON
* Web Application Stored On GitHub
