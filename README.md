#### Open Sourcing A City GIS Web Site
=======================

This project was created by [Chris Fricke](https://github.com/bmoregeo), [Corey Fields](https://github.com/fieldsco), and [Jonah Adkins](https://github.com/jonahadkins) as part of a [GISi](http://gisinc.com/) sponsored hack-a-thon for employees.

=======================

Currently, the City of Williamsburg [offers it's GIS data](http://www.williamsburgva.gov/Index.aspx?page=793) as a downloadable  
zipped shapefile.

The city's current GIS site is an [ArcGIS Flex Viewer](http://williamsburg.timmons.com/flex/index.html) implementation.

The purpose of this project was to replicate the base functionality of the  
city's current website using open source components.

This site uses:
* Leaflet API
* Tiles Created With Tilemill
* GIS Data as GeoJSON
* Web Application Stored On GitHub
